/**
 * WHY THE BATCH IS NOT AWAITED BY THE TOOL CALL.
 *
 * pi delivers a queued user message only "after the current assistant turn finishes
 * executing its tool calls" (docs/rpc.md, `steer`). A tool that awaits a multi-hour
 * batch therefore freezes the supervising conversation for the whole batch: every
 * message the operator types lands in the steering queue, and none of `status`, `add`,
 * `remove` or `stop` can run — including the live append this queue was designed for.
 *
 * So `run`/`continue` start the loop and return. Nothing in the loop actually needed the
 * turn: children are already async subagent runs, and every phase transition is already
 * persisted in progress.json. The two things the turn did give are replaced explicitly —
 * esc-abort by `stop`, and the streaming card by `status`.
 *
 * One property is worth keeping from the old shape: a refusal (disarmed queue, dirty
 * tree, held lock) settles in milliseconds and belongs in the tool result, not in a
 * notification that arrives after the tool already claimed "started". Hence the grace
 * race below — settle within DETACH_GRACE_MS and the text is returned inline and NOT
 * notified; outlive it and the driver detaches and reports through the notify path.
 *
 * State is per-cwd rather than global because the run lock is per-cwd: two projects can
 * legitimately have a driver each, the same project cannot.
