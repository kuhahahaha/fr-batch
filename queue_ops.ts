 * the driver would make it a writer, and a driver holding a stale in-memory snapshot while the
 * operator appends is exactly the lost update the two-file split exists to prevent. So the
 * sweep runs from the tool path, which is already the single writer of queue.json.
 *
 * REFUSED WHILE A DRIVER IS LIVE, unlike add/remove. Those touch only entries the driver is
 * not looking at; this one deletes from progress.json, which the driver read-modify-writes on
 * every phase transition — so a sweep landing between its read and its write is silently
 * undone, resurrecting the entries as orphans. Waiting for the batch to end costs nothing:
