// `pi --mode json -p` subprocess (subagent-runner.ts modelAttemptsLoop) and when
// the model call fails the failure is in the harness, so the model never gets a
// turn in which it could call contact_supervisor. Detection is therefore
// post-mortem, from the child's own failure evidence.
//
// A TOOL-level outage (the child's own bash/curl) is different: the child is
// alive and can report it. That path is handled by watchSupervisorAsks().
//
// Layering, deliberately: pi's in-child retry (settings retry.maxRetries 3,
// baseDelayMs 2000 -> ~14s) is the BLIP filter and is left alone. This layer is
// the OUTAGE handler and works in minutes. fallbackModels stays empty on the
// fr-* agents, or an outage is disguised as "several models failed for real".
//
// Roles can now sit on DIFFERENT providers (see resolveChildConfig), which the
// empty-fallback rule predates: a fallback across providers is not the same
// outage twice. It is still unconfigured, and two mechanical facts bound whoever
// revisits that, both established by reading pi-subagents rather than guessing:
//   * a fallback list is STATIC, agent-scoped config. buildModelCandidates reads
//     `agent.fallbackModels`; no spawn/RPC/workflow-child param carries one, so
//     "fall back to whatever the supervising session runs" cannot be expressed
//     there at all — only here, where the session snapshot lives.
//   * pi's in-child fallback re-invokes with the SAME `--session <file>`, so the
//     second model continues the transcript. A fallback implemented HERE cannot:
//     RPC `resume` takes { id, message } and reads the model from the persisted
//     descriptor, so switching models means a FRESH child over a half-edited
//     tree — losing exactly the work-preservation this layer exists for.
